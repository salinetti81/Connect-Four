Description

This is a version of a Connect Four game.

-HTML 
-CSS 
-JavaScript
-jQuery

Features
-At the start of the game, there are two input fields for the players to enter their names. 
-Once the "ENTER" button is clicked, the names are store as player1 and player2 and out put back onto the page. 
-Also, once clicked, the div holding this info is hidden and a new div appears, logging
the players names and a button appears to start the game.
-When the start button is clicked, the page pulls up, revealing the game board and buttons to drop chips into each column.
-The game starts with red, and as each chip is dropped, the colors switch between red and blue. 
-I tried different methoods for tracking a winning combination, but could not get any of these to work.
-There is a replay button that resets the page and clears the board. 

Future Implementations
-Mainly, I need to get the winning combinations to work.
-I would also like to fix the restart button so instead of refreshing the page, it just resets the board, but keeps track of how many times
each player has won.
-I also want to add a scoreboard that keeps a running tally.
